# This will be the corrected JavaScript section - let me provide the key fixes:

# 1. Fix the type checking logic:
# Change: device.device_type !== null
# To: device.device_type != null && device.device_type !== ""

# 2. Fix the device type lookup:
# The API returns device_type as the name, so we need to find by name, not ID
